GrowthCoin - a fork of Diamond, with several algorithms fixed and improved. It is decendent of Novacoin/PPCoin with Pow/PoS. It combines the great features from Luckycoin (random blocks) and Florincoin (transaction message). 

Proof of stake coin is more resilient to 51% attack. Since 51% hashpower is not enough to execute a 51% attack. The attackers must also have at least 51% stake.

GrowthCoin provides yearly interest rate of 5.95%, for stakes that are held during that period of time. This equivalent to an annual interest of 5.95%. PoS blocks will be generated if the stake are held for more than 5 days. There is a hard limit of 2 billion coins.
